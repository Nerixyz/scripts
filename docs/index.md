# Introduction

This repository/site contains some scripts/snippets/configs/tools/... I often use throughout different projects and/or machines.
It's mainly for my setup, but feel free to add new scripts or adjust scripts to fit your setup (e.g. by adding parameters).
You can also edit the documentation (see :material-file-edit-outline: top right). Take a look at the README of the repository for more info.

You can get access to the actual files in the `scripts/` folder [inside the repository](https://github.com/Nerixyz/scripts/blob/main/scripts).

## Organization

Scripts that should be in your PATH environment variable, are in `scripts/bin/{os}`.
Other than that, scripts are organized by category.

## My Setup

I'm on Windows using VS Code for development and PowerShell as my default shell.
On WSL2, I'm using zsh.
