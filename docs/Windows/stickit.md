# StickIt (pin an image)

When working with just one monitor, you often find yourself tabbing between windows when for example checking documentation.

StickIt is a small Windows tool that displays an image above all other windows. The image is the currently copied image, making it easy to use screenshots (<kbd>:material-microsoft-windows:</kbd> + <kbd>:material-apple-keyboard-shift:</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>).

The tool is open-source at [:octicons-mark-github-16: Nerixyz/stickit](https://github.com/nerixyz/stickit) ([:octicons-download-16: Releases](https://github.com/Nerixyz/stickit/releases)).
